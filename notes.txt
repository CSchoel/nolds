Files to alter when version is changed:
CHANGELOG.md
setup.py
doc/source/conf.py

Build Wheel:
python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal

Test:
pip install dist/nolds-X.X.X-py2.py3-none-any.whl
cd ..
python
>>> import nolds.examples as ex
>>> ex.plot_lyap()

Run Unittests:
python -m unittest nolds.test_measures

Problem when using py -2 -m pip instead of pip:
- Somehow in this scenario pip thinks, the package is already installed
- but will also be unable to uninstall it
=> Use pip directly!

Upload zip file:
twine upload -r pypitest dist/nolds-X.X.X*
twine upload dist/nolds-X.X.X*

Allow source download:
git tag X.X.X
git push origin master --tags

Update documentation:
cd doc
make html
