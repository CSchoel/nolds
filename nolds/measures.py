  Estimates the largest Lyapunov exponent using the algorithm of Rosenstein
  et al. [lr-1]_.

  Explanation of Lyapunov exponents:
    See lyap_e.

  Explanation of the algorithm:
    The algorithm of Rosenstein et al. is only able to recover the largest
    Lyapunov exponent, but behaves rather robust to parameter choices.

    The idea for the algorithm relates closely to the definition of Lyapunov
    exponents. First, the dynamics of the data are reconstructed using a delay
    embedding method with a lag, such that each value x_i of the data is mapped
    to the vector

    X_i = [x_i, x_(i+lag), x_(i+2*lag), ..., x_(i+(emb_dim-1) * lag)]

    For each such vector X_i, we find the closest neighbor X_j using the
    euclidean distance. We know that as we follow the trajectories from X_i and
    X_j in time in a chaotic system the distances between X_(i+k) and X_(j+k)
    denoted as d_i(k) will increase according to a power law
    d_i(k) = c * e^(lambda * k) where lambda is a good approximation of the
    highest Lyapunov exponent, because the exponential expansion along the axis
    associated with this exponent will quickly dominate the expansion or
    contraction along other axes.

    To calculate lambda, we look at the logarithm of the distance trajectory,
    because log(d_i(k)) = log(c) + lambda * k. This gives a set of lines
    (one for each index i) whose slope is an approximation of lambda. We
    therefore extract the mean log trajectory d'(k) by taking the mean of
    log(d_i(k)) over all orbit vectors X_i. We then fit a straight line to
    the plot of d'(k) versus k. The slope of the line gives the desired
    parameter lambda.

  Method for choosing min_tsep:
    Usually we want to find neighbors between points that are close in phase
    space but not too close in time, because we want to avoid spurious
    correlations between the obtained trajectories that originate from temporal
    dependencies rather than the dynamic properties of the system. Therefore it
    is critical to find a good value for min_tsep. One rather plausible
    estimate for this value is to set min_tsep to the mean period of the
    signal, which can be obtained by calculating the mean frequency using the
    fast fourier transform. This procedure is used by default if the user sets
    min_tsep = None.

  Method for choosing lag:
    Another parameter that can be hard to choose by instinct alone is the lag
    between individual values in a vector of the embedded orbit. Here,
    Rosenstein et al. suggest to set the lag to the distance where the
    autocorrelation function drops below 1 - 1/e times its original (maximal)
    value. This procedure is used by default if the user sets lag = None.

  Estimates the Lyapunov exponents for the given data using the algorithm of
  Eckmann et al. [le-1]_.

  Recommendations for parameter settings by Eckmann et al.:
    * long recording time improves accuracy, small tau does not
    * use large values for emb_dim
    * matrix_dim should be 'somewhat larger than the expected number of
      positive Lyapunov exponents'
    * min_nb = min(2 * matrix_dim, matrix_dim + 4)

  Explanation of Lyapunov exponents:
    The Lyapunov exponent describes the rate of separation of two
    infinitesimally close trajectories of a dynamical system in phase space.
    In a chaotic system, these trajectories diverge exponentially following
    the equation:

    \|X(t, X_0) - X(t, X_0 + eps)| = e^(lambda * t) * \|eps|

    In this equation X(t, X_0) is the trajectory of the system X starting at
    the point X_0 in phase space at time t. eps is the (infinitesimal)
    difference vector and lambda is called the Lyapunov exponent. If the
    system has more than one free variable, the phase space is
    multidimensional and each dimension has its own Lyapunov exponent. The
    existence of at least one positive Lyapunov exponent is generally seen as
    a strong indicator for chaos.

  Explanation of the Algorithm:
    To calculate the Lyapunov exponents analytically, the Jacobian of the
    system is required. The algorithm of Eckmann et al. therefore tries to
    estimate this Jacobian by reconstructing the dynamics of the system from
    which the time series was obtained. For this, several steps are required:

    * Embed the time series [x_1, x_2, ..., x_(N-1)] in an orbit of emb_dim
      dimensions (map each point x_i of the time series to a vector
      [x_i, x_(i+1), x_(i+2), ... x_(i+emb_dim-1)]).
    * For each vector X_i in this orbit find a radius r_i so that at least
      min_nb other vectors lie within (chebyshev-)distance r_i around X_i.
      These vectors will be called "neighbors" of X_i.
    * Find the Matrix T_i that sends points from the neighborhood of X_i to
      the neighborhood of X_(i+1). To avoid undetermined values in T_i, we
      construct T_i not with size (emb_dim x emb_dim) but with size
      (matrix_dim x matrix_dim), so that we have a larger "step size" m in the
      X_i, which are now defined as X'_i = [x_i, x_(i+m), x_(i+2m),
      ... x_(i+(matrix_dim-1)*m)]. This means that emb_dim-1 must be divisible
      by matrix_dim-1. The T_i are then found by a linear least squares fit,
      assuring that T_i (X_j - X_i) ~= X_(j+m) - X_(i+m) for any X_j in the
      neighborhood of X_i.
    * Starting with i = 1 and Q_0 = identity successively decompose the matrix
      T_i * Q_(i-1) into the matrices Q_i and R_i by a QR-decomposition.
    * Calculate the Lyapunov exponents from the mean of the logarithm of the
      diagonal elements of the matrices R_i. To normalize the Lyapunov
      exponents, they have to be divided by m and by the step size tau of the
      original time series.

  Computes the sample entropy of the given data.

  Explanation of the sample entropy:
    The sample entropy of a time series is defined as the negative natural
    logarithm of the conditional probability that two sequences similar for
    emb_dim points remain similar at the next point, excluding self-matches.

    A lower value for the sample entropy therefore corresponds to a higher
    probability indicating more self-similarity.

  Explanation of the algorithm:
    The algorithm constructs all subsequences of length emb_dim
    [s_1, s_2, s_3, ...] and then counts each pair (s_i, s_j) with i != j
    where dist(s_i, s_j) < tolerance. The same process is repeated for all
    subsequences of length emb_dim + 1. The sum of similar sequence pairs
    with length emb_dim + 1 is divided by the sum of similar sequence pairs
    with length emb_dim. The result of the algorithm is the negative logarithm
    of this ratio/probability.

             debug_data=False, plot_file=None):
  """
  Calculates the Hurst exponent by a standard rescaled range (R/S) approach.

  Explanation of Hurst exponent:
    The Hurst exponent is a measure for the "long-term memory" of a
    time series, meaning the long statistical dependencies in the data that do
    not originate from cycles.

    It originates from H.E. Hursts observations of the problem of long-term
    storage in water reservoirs. If x_i is the discharge of a river in year i
    and we observe this discharge for N years, we can calculate the storage
    capacity that would be required to keep the discharge steady at its mean
    value.

    To do so, we first substract the mean over all x_i from the individual
    x_i to obtain the departures x'_i from the mean for each year i. As the
    excess or deficit in discharge always carrys over from year i to year i+1,
    we need to examine the cumulative sum of x'_i, denoted by y_i. This
    cumulative sum represents the filling of our hypothetical storage. If the
    sum is above 0, we are storing excess discharge from the river, if it is
    below zero we have compensated a deficit in discharge by releasing
    water from the storage. The range (maximum - minimum) R of y_i therefore
    represents the total capacity required for the storage.

    Hurst showed that this value follows a steady trend for varying N if it
    is normalized by the standard deviation sigma over the x_i. Namely he
    obtained the following formula:

    R/sigma = (N/2)^K

    In this equation, K is called the Hurst exponent. Its value is 0.5 for a
    purely brownian motion, but becomes greater for time series that exhibit
    a bias in one direction.

  Explanation of the algorithm:
    The rescaled range (R/S) approach is directly derived from Hurst's
    definition. The time series of length N is split into non-overlapping
    subseries of length n. Then, R and S (S = sigma) are calculated for each
    subseries and the mean is taken over all subseries yielding (R/S)_n. This
    process is repeated for several lengths n. Finally, the exponent K is
    obtained by fitting a straight line to the plot of log((R/S)_n) vs log(n).

    There seems to be no consensus how to chose the subseries lenghts n.
    This function therefore leaves the choice to the user. The module provides
    some utility functions for "typical" values:

      * binary_n: N/2, N/4, N/8, ...
      * logarithmic_n: min_n, min_n * f, min_n * f^2, ...

  Calculates the correlation dimension with the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm

  Explanation of correlation dimension:
    The correlation dimension is a characteristic measure that can be used
    to describe the geometry of chaotic attractors. It is defined using the
    correlation sum C(r) which is the fraction of pairs of points X_i in the
    phase space whose distance is smaller than r.

    If the relation between C(r) and r can be described by the power law

    C(r) ~ r^D

    then D is called the correlation dimension of the system.

    In a d-dimensional system, the maximum value for D is d. This value is
    obtained for systems that expand uniformly in each dimension with time.
    The lowest possible value is 0 for a system with constant C(r) (i.e. a
    system that visits just one point in the phase space). Generally if D is
    lower than d and the system has an attractor, this attractor is called
    "strange" and D is a measure of this "strangeness".

  Explanation of the algorithm:
    The Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm calculates C(r) for a range of
    different r and then fits a straight line into the plot of log(C(r))
    versus log(r).

    This version of the algorithm is created for one-dimensional (scalar) time
    series. Therefore, before calculating C(r), a delay embedding of the time
    series is performed to yield emb_dim dimensional vectors
    Y_i = [X_i, X_(i+1), X_(i+2), ... X_(i+embd_dim-1)]. Choosing a higher
    value for emb_dim allows to reconstruct higher dimensional dynamics and
    avoids "systematic errors due to corrections to scaling".

  Performs a detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) on the given data

  Recommendations for parameter settings by Hardstone et al.:
    * nvals should be equally spaced on a logarithmic scale so that each window
      scale hase the same weight
    * min(nvals) < 4 does not make much sense as fitting a polynomial (even if
      it is only of order 1) to 3 or less data points is very prone.
    * max(nvals) > len(data) / 10 does not make much sense as we will then have
      less than 10 windows to calculate the average fluctuation
    * use overlap=True to obtain more windows and therefore better statistics
      (at an increased computational cost)

  Explanation of DFA:
    Detrended fluctuation analysis, much like the Hurst exponent, is used to
    find long-term statistical dependencies in time series.

    The idea behind DFA originates from the definition of self-affine
    processes. A process X is said to be self-affine if the standard deviation
    of the values within a window of length n changes with the window length
    factor L in a power law:

    std(X,L * n) = L^H * std(X, n)

    where std(X, k) is the standard deviation of the process X calculated over
    windows of size k. In this equation, H is called the Hurst parameter, which
    behaves indeed very similar to the Hurst exponent.

    Like the Hurst exponent, H can be obtained from a time series by
    calculating std(X,n) for different n and fitting a straight line to the
    plot of log(std(X,n)) versus log(n).

    To calculate a single std(X,n), the time series is split into windows of
    equal length n, so that the ith window of this size has the form

    W_(n,i) = [x_i, x_(i+1), x_(i+2), ... x_(i+n-1)]

    The value std(X,n) is then obtained by calculating std(W_(n,i)) for each i
    and averaging the obtained values over i.

    The aforementioned definition of self-affinity, however, assumes that the
    process is  non-stationary (i.e. that the standard deviation changes over
    time) and it is highly influenced by local and global trends of the time
    series.

    To overcome these problems, an estimate alpha of H is calculated by using a
    "walk" or "signal profile" instead of the raw time series. This walk is
    obtained by substracting the mean and then taking the cumulative sum of the
    original time series. The local trends are removed for each window
    separately by fitting a polynomial p_(n,i) to the window W_(n,i) and then
    calculating W'_(n,i) = W_(n,i) - p_(n,i) (element-wise substraction).

    We then calculate std(X,n) as before only using the "detrended" window
    W'_(n,i) instead of W_(n,i). Instead of H we obtain the parameter alpha
    from the line fitting.

    For alpha < 1 the underlying process is stationary and can be modelled as
    fractional Gaussian noise with H = alpha. This means for alpha = 0.5 we
    have no correlation or "memory", for 0.5 < alpha < 1 we have a memory with
    positive correlation and for alpha < 0.5 the correlation is negative.

    For alpha > 1 the underlying process is non-stationary and can be modeled
    as fractional Brownian motion with H = alpha - 1.
